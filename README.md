# JavaGUI
Utilized the Java Swing GUI to create an information system that reads, writes, and updates employee information to and from .txt files.

TO START:

DOWNLOAD "Project_Final.zip"

UNZIP file

DOWNLOAD "jcalendar-1.4.jar" and save in a location you will remember

ADD the jcalendar-1.4.jar to your IDE (I used NetBeans 8.2) Help/Tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzAC7fzC9uY

OPEN "Project_Final" project in your IDE

RUN "Project" 6.(a) IF you are prompted to "Reslove issues" click "Resolve Problems" and then "Resolve" on the top right corner. Then navigate to where you downloaded the jcalendar-1.4.jar and select it. This will import the jcalendar-1.4.jar library and allow the application to run correctly.
